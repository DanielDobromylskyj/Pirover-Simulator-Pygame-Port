## About This Repository

This repository is a **port** of the original [pirover_simulator](https://github.com/legorovers/pirover_simulator) project. The main change is that this version uses **Pygame** for graphical rendering instead of **Pyglet**. All other functionality and features are intended to closely match the original project, with the added compatibility for Pygame.

For details on the original project, please check out the original repository [here](https://github.com/legorovers/pirover_simulator).

> **Note:**
> This repository and the original project are **not officially affiliated**;
> this port is maintained independently.
